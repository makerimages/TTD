## Quick Start

* In the project directory initialize and update submodules: `git submodule update --init`.
* Open the project in your favourite Java IDE (we are using IntelliJ IDEA).
* Get coding!

## Pull requests

* Only submit a pull request for ### working code . Nobody likes merging crashes.
* Do not submit plain `formatting fixes` these are done by Makerimages and fuuuu, whenever neccessary.
* If you add some complete new thing, describe it as detailed as possible.

## Issue reporting

* Detail the issue as percisely as possible.
* Attatch steps to reproduce the issue.
* Make sure you are running the latest build :). Otherwize, we migth have fixed it already and will spend time trying to track down a bug that doesnt exist anymore. Such things makes for very grumpy devs. Grumpy devs spend less time coding and more time doing stuff that makes them less grumpy.
* Include the ###full error log !
